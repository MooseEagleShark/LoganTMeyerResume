Some notes from my journey:

12-31-21 - As I have been out of tech for nearly around 7 years, working primarily in non-tech construction /city development /airbnb, ect. coming back to tech (took some intro to computing classes as part of my Mechanical Eng. degree at CU Boulder, as well as always beign the 'tech guy' for the family) has been a welcome homecoming albeit there are a few things that I thought would be more 'cloud' streamlined now:

Getting an IDE is still a pain on a mac. I was really hoping there would be a better cloud solution for this.  I was hoping that Github's Codespace would be everything I need with dependencies ect. but it turns out it's still beta only : (

  I used to use Text Wrangler or something and now it looks like people are using Atom.  Atom installed and partially set up.  I know I will still need to instal / learn python and mac compatabilities soon.

  For the record, I did instal Ubuntu on my Mac, but the driver for my wifi didn't automatically integrate and honestly managing all of this hardware and OS in the age of cloud seems way too 2010.  Kinda surprised someone hasn't figured out the Cloud IDE thing.
